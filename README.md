# C-Word-and-Image-Processing
The first program (analysis.c) takes an input text, and outputs a table with the amount of times each word appears in the text. It uses a custom Linked List to accomplish this in C

The second program (imEdge.c) is used for edge detection of an input image. This is accomplished using Sobel Edge Detection.

Please read the PDF for much more thorough documentation with screenshots.
